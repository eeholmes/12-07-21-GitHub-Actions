## GitHub Actions

This helps you automate tasks when you push (say) changes to GitHub. The super common one is to check and R package and getting that nifty *Passing* badge. *Getting R CMD check working is one of the harder GitHub Actions. I wouldn't start with this!*

![badge](https://github.com/RWorkflow-Workshop-2021/pkgdown-template/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)

### Basic steps to set up a GitHub Action

* Create the Action yaml file (instructions) in a folder `.github/workflows`. Each action gets its own file.
* Push to your repo or create on GitHub directly

That's it. GitHub will detect that Action and run it for you when the event to trigger the action happens. You specify what events trigger it in the your yaml file.

### Let's see a simple example

Let's start with a super simple example. We want to update a `Readme.md` from `Readme.Rmd` every time the `Readme.Rmd` file or the data used in that Rmd are updated. Our Rmd just has 2 lines.

```
a <- read.csv("test.csv")
knitr::kable(a)
```

* Open up RStudio and make sure you can see hidden files. Go to 'More' in the file viewer tab and make sure 'Show hidden files' is checked
* Create a folder called `.github`
* In that folder, create a folder called `workflows`
* In that we create our GitHub Action yaml file
```
name: Render README

jobs:
  render:
    name: Render README
    runs-on: macOS-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v1
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-pandoc@v1
      - name: Install packages
        run: Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "knitr"))'
      - name: Render README
        run: Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd", output_format = "md_document")'
      - name: Commit results
        run: |
          git commit README.md -m 'Re-build README.Rmd' || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push origin || echo "No changes to commit"
```

### Getting started using `usethis`

```
usethis::use_github_actions()
```
Note what it does because you might need to change things.

```
usethis::use_github_actions_badge()
```
Set up the `R CMD check` badge.

### Start adapting for your own purposes

Look at examples:

* Start here [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) *I often struggle with the r-lib actions. Theirs tend to be more complicated than I need.*
* Here how I am using it:
[VRData](https://github.com/nwfsc-math-bio/VRData/tree/master/.github/workflows) to run scripts on data that is pushed.
* Read all about [Github actions with R](https://orchid00.github.io/actions_sandbox/)
* [This blog helped me](https://fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2020/04/30/rendering-your-readme-with-github-actions/). It's a write-up of a colleague putting together his first GitHub Action.
* [Here](https://github.com/UW-Upwelling-Project/imageryML/blob/main/.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml) is an example of setting the environment so that `R CMD check` doesn't run `donttest{}` in examples.
* Look in the [Fisheries Integrated Toolbox](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools) for the `.github/workflows` folder and look at examples of workflows.

You can also use GitHub Actions is [many more ways](https://youtu.be/R8_veQiYBjI) to help you automate workflows.
